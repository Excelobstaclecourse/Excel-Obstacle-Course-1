Hello,
I hope you are doing well
I was hoping if you wouldn't mind my requesting to make the
"ExcelObstacleCourse" repository Private rather than Public.
I certainly do not mind if you keep all these contents to yourself, It's just that 
I am trying to migrate to a paid model.

Originally all my stuff was free on GitHub however the 'donation' model
I was running was totally ineffective.

I don't expect to get extremely wealthy from my obstacle courses however I need
to get out of debt and send my two kids to college, as well as care for my aging parents
and in-laws

Thanks for your help very much,

Sincerely, 
Ryan (Excel Obstacle Course)
